# Wooga tools-developer task

Welcome to the Wooga tools-developer task.

## Intro

This repository contains resource assets from one of our games which need to be processed in various ways.
The usage of these processed files range from downloadable asset bundles for the game or resources for marketing etc.
The different tasks can be executed with an all mighty helper tool called `woogac`. This program serves as an closed source utility
tool which you have to assume no source code is available. You can find this tool in the `bin` directory.

## Objective

The main objective is to write a `script` / `pipeline` / `tool` to automate the resource processing tasks.
You can use any scripting language, build tools or frameworks you want, but you must use the `woogac` tool to accomplish the task. You'll will find a documentation document for `woogac` in the [docs](docs/) directory or you can read it from the commandline with `woogac --help`.
